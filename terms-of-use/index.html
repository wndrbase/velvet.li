	<h2>
		1.&nbsp;&nbsp;General information
	</h2>

	<p>
		Velvet Finance Limited (herein referred to as “Velvet”) is registered as a Company in England and Wales (№11413658) and with the Financial Conduct Authority under the Payment Services Regulations 2017 [FRN <a href="https://register.fca.org.uk/s/firm?id=0010X00004aB9JNQA0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">912305</a>] for the provision of payment services. Registered Office: 4 Gedling Street, Unit 6 Sneinton Market, Nottingham, England, NG1 1DS.
	</p>

	<p>
		This Agreement sets out the terms and conditions on which we will provide you with Services from time to time.
	</p>

	<p>
		This Agreement together with the Client Application Form and other related agreements and notices that we may provide you with from time to time together constitute the terms of your agreement with us. These are our General Terms and Conditions upon which we intend to rely.
	</p>

	<p>
		For your own benefit and protection, you should read these terms carefully before signing this Agreement. If you do not understand any point contained within this Agreement, please ask for further information before signing it.
	</p>

	<p>
		You may also be given additional terms and conditions when you take out a particular product or Service. These additional or account-specific terms take priority over those found in these General Terms and Conditions.
	</p>

	<p>
		Where a conflict between the General Terms and Conditions and other applicable agreements, regulation or conditions mentioned in this Agreement exists, this other agreement, regulation or these other conditions shall always prevail.
	</p>

	<p>
		If one or more of these provisions is or are invalid, then a provision shall apply which resembles such a provision as much as possible and which is valid. The other provisions of these General Terms and Conditions shall not be affected. It is possible that you yourself also use general terms and conditions. In that case these General Terms and Conditions will apply, and not your general terms and conditions. Your own general terms and conditions only apply if we agree to this with you in writing.
	</p>
